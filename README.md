- [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [React-Native-Maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-maps)

## :anchor: Structure

We are using **ReactJS** to create a frontend application to register a new collect point. In this web module the user can upload an image **(React-DropZone)**, select a point in the map **(LeafLet)** and select what items (lamp, oil and etc..) are collected by this point. We are using the IBGE API to populate the UF and City Component.

In the mobile application we are using **React-Native** and is possible to find the point near from the user according to GPS location (react-native-maps). In the mobile application you can filter the points that collect a specific item/items and see a picture from the local.

Finally in the backend, we are using the **NodeJS** and all kind of database transaction is doing in this layer.
